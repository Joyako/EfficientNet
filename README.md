## Face Recognition in PyTorch 
### This project mainly contains various loss function and light neural network.

### Light Neural Network
<li> MobileNet-v3
<li> EfficientNet

### Loss function:  
These functions addresses deep face recognition (FR) problem under open-set protocol, 
where ideal face features are expected to have smaller maximal intra-class distance 
than minimal inter-class distance under a suitably chosen met- ric space.
<li> Softmax:
